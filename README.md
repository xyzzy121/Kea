###### *with GUI and everything!*  
Kea is an appication for downloading comics from https://www.webtoons.com for personal, offline use.
## How To: Download
Download [Kea v.1.3.3](https://github.com/RustingRobot/Kea/releases/download/v1.3.3/Kea.v1.3.3.zip)
or look at all releases [here](https://github.com/RustingRobot/Kea/releases).  
After the .zip folder downloaded unzip it and run Kea.exe.  
*(all files in the Kea folder need to stay in the same directory)*

To edit Kea, download everything and open ***Kea.sln*** in Visual Studio.

* enter all links of the comics you want to download into the uppermost text field  
	(Links must be seperated by a line break)
* press the ***add all to queue*** button to, uh... add them to the queue  
	(If a comic does not get added, the link was invalid)
* Use ***remove selected*** and ***remove all*** to delete comics you dont want to download
<!-- end of the list -->

* The default start chapter will always be 1 and the default end chapter 'end'
* These can be changed to any number greater than zero  
	(the start chapter needs to be smaller than the end chapter)
<!-- end of the list -->

* Select a save folder by pressing the ***folder*** button  
* Check ***each catoon*** for the application to save all chapters of a cartoon under a common folder (***each chapter*** works likewise)  
* The images of a chapter can either be saved as a single PDF document, multible images (.jpg) or one long image (.png)
	(since all images already get bundled together if a PDF or one long image is created, the option ***each chapter*** is deactivated)  
* Warning: if a chapter is so long that the resulting merged image exceeds 30,000 pixels in height it will be down scaled (in some cases even until the text isn't readable anymore). In those cases the PDF option may be better.  
* Now you can click the ***start*** button and wait (all controls should be deactivated until the download is done)
